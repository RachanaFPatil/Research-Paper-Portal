1,Information-Science and Engineering,Intelligent Plant Watering System: Smart city,"P. Kusuma, S. Rajashree, M. L. Chayadevi, Mona, K. S. Shreedevi and S. Geetha",IEEE,"�In the present situation, human beings are very busy in their daily routine, making them not have enough time to take care of the plants. By making use of advanced technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT) one can design a system that can be used to monitor and update the progress of plant growth and provide plants with the required amount of water by helping the owner in taking care of plants even in their absentia. This paper presents a system for watering plants that considers weather conditions as one of the main parameters that can be taken from Google Weather and present conditions of the plant from the sensor. The system makes use of three sensors namely temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Both data from Google and sensors are analyzed using an ML model to predict whether to water the plant and how much water should be given to the plant at the scheduled time",10.1109/ICETCS61022.2024.10543720,,,

4,Electronics and Communication Engineering,Investigation and Monitoring Deforestation by Evaluating the Satellite Images and Machine Learning,"Ashwini R Malipatil,  Pallavi C V,  Jayashree, Geetha L S",IEEE,"A woodland can be restored by planting new trees, caring for existing ones, and conserving natural resources. The effects of climate change could be mitigated with the help of new financing for woodland rehabilitation initiatives around the globe. Current poll methods for rehabilitation, while useful, could be improved so that such vast efforts can be tracked more effectively. Using satellite data, a machine-learning algorithm was developed to monitor the trees and plants in the forest area. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the viability of monitoring replanting initiatives using machine learning and high-resolution satellite images. The purpose of this research is to create an innovative but challenging collection using high-resolution satellite images. We discuss the training and testing of a random forest machine learning model on this one-of-a-kind dataset, which was collected from a location in northern Fiji where a native forest was being restored. Testing the proposed RF-Ranger model on a dataset, it was found to be highly accurate, with a categorization accuracy of 97.5% and a Macro-F1 score of 97.4% on unobserved pixels. Conservation International (CI), a nonprofit environmental group studied in cooperation for this study, may oversee the current replanting location assessed here. The proposed model, RF-Ranger, was able to correctly recognize plants in forest regeneration areas and therefore has the potential to be used for large-scale monitoring of such efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCAI58221.2023.10199460,,,
5,Department of Mathematics,Text Detection from Image and Video Frames using Improved Golden Jackal Optimization based Shallow Convolutional Neural Network,"Chitra M, M. J. Roopa, M. K. Prakruthi, M. L. Chayadevi, M. Rajani Shree, M. D. Swetha",IEEE,"Text Detection from Image and Video Frames Using Improved Golden Jackal Optimization based Shallow Convolutional Neural Network Text detection plays a significant role in reading the text content worldwide and it is difficult to localize due to the natural scene image texts being distributed. The lower resolution, text orientation, size, and writing style variations make text detection a challenging process. To overcome the above-defined problems, this article proposed a Cosine Similarity-Golden Jackal Optimization (CSGJO) based Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The datasets utilized for estimating the proposed method are ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, and CTW1500 datasets. The data augmentation and normalization are utilized as preprocessing techniques which enhances the dataset size and removes null values. The pre-processed images are given to the feature extraction process using SE-ResNet152 which extracts the relevant features from the input. The extracted features are given to CSGJO which can consider the correlation among various features. After selecting the features, the shallow CNN is employed for detecting the text from input and video frames. The precision, recall, and f-measure are considered as metrics for assessing model performance. The CSGJO-based shallow CNN attained high precision of 92.57%, 93.69%, and 89.46% for ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500 and CTW1500 datasets respectively. The proposed model performed better when compared to existing methods like Multi-Headed Self-Attention (MHSA), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Decoupled Feature Pyramid Networks (DFPN).

6,Department of Physics,Sign Language Conversion to Speech with the Application of KNN Algorithm,Rajni Shree M,IEEE,"Sign language is mainly used by those who are unable to speak, to communicate. The vast majority of people are not able to understand the Universal Sign Language (unless they have learned it) and due to this lack of knowledge about the language, they have difficulty communicating with mute people. This paper focuses on developing an application that bridges the gap between mute people and the rest of society. It captures gestures made by a person using American sign language (ASL), and converts them into corresponding text and speech in real time. The proposed study will acquire translations of sign language gestures in text, which will be later transformed into audio. In this way, a sign language translator will be developed. Further, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized for the detection of different gestures. CNNs are highly effective for solving computer vision problems and can detect the desired features with high degrees of accuracy upon exercising sufficient training. K-NN classification is used to recognize sign language.",,,,
